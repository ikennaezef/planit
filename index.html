                <h4>Flexible Scheduling</h4>
                <p>
                  Your employees have the power to pick up, drop, and swap their
                  shifts. This gives employees more control of their work-life
                  balance, while freeing managers to focus on your customers.

                <h4>Time Clock</h4>
                <p>
                  The mobile GPS clock-in/out feature ensures employees are
                  always on time, on location. If someone is late or forgets to
                  clock, notifications to employees and managers keep everyone
                  working together.
